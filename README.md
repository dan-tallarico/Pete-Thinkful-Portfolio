# Pete-Thinkful-Portfolio
Portfolio for Thinkful work.
This is a project for the Thinkful Web Dev class. This portfolio is full of wonderful examples showcasing the fundamentals of CSS and HTML. Marvel at the different article sections, the styling, background colors and more. A keen eye will see how the links change on hover and when they have been clicked. The HTML forms the various containers of the page, organizing the content neatly. Pete Thinkful will be highly employable once this page is published to the web.
